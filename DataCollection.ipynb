Everything is patriarchal. This is NOT to say that women are not valued in the society and this is not to say that woman towards male domestic violence or other abuses does not exist. It does, but on a far lesser scale. \\n\\nIn most cases, the women coming into the shelters have been victims of abuse and have nowhere to go. Houses where they lived are traditionally on the male side, if married. That means you are living with the husband/S.O. AND his parents/grandparents, etc. If you are being abused inside this family, chances are consent is being given through acquiescence and you no longer would want to be there. But where to go? Your family is generally too poor to take you back in some cases. \\n\\nIn this area, if you end up on the streets, you are highly likely to be raped around here. We have a high homeless and drug abuser population. This has been common in many areas where I have lived/worked. I think it is an important factor for there to be safe spaces for women to sleep and be ok in these areas, without fear of rape or abuse from random men. I am not in any way saying that women are LESS capable of handling themselves but they are, in general, weaker in muscular tone than a man who would be the aggressor. \\nAgain, this is not to say women cannot be stronger than men, but the average woman around here is not as being athletically fit in a muscular way is not prized in the culture.\\n\\nThere is also the psychological stressors. After being raped, women are almost always shaken and traumatized. So, in this instance, it is very important that a space be provided where they can heal away from a person who fits the agressor\\'s descriptions -which is in most cases a male. \\n\\n2) The women keep the children on higher averages and many women\\'s shelters can accommodate and provide a safe space. \\n\\nWhere I live....there are hardly any shelters for minors and NO emergency shelters for minors. I have yet to understand that. \\n\\n There is a need for women\\'s only shelters that goes beyond someone saying, \"I only want to help women, screw men\".

The assumption that women are naturally better caregivers is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not like commercials in which bumbling dads mess up the laundry and competent wives have to bustle in and fix it. The assumption that women are naturally better housekeepers is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to have to make alimony payments. Alimony is set up to combat the fact that women have been historically expected to prioritize domestic duties over professional goals, thus minimizing their earning potential if their \"traditional\" marriages end. The assumption that wives should make babies instead of money is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want anyone to get raped in prison. Permissiveness and jokes about prison rape are part of rape culture, which is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want anyone to be falsely accused of rape. False rape accusations discredit rape victims, which reinforces rape culture, which is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to be lonely and we do not hate \"nice guys.\" The idea that certain people are inherently more valuable than other people because of superficial physical attributes is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to have to pay for dinner. We want the opportunity to achieve financial success on par with men in any field we choose (and are qualified for), and the fact that we currently don\\'t is part of patriarchy. The idea that men should coddle and provide for women, and/or purchase their affections in romantic contexts, is condescending and damaging and part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to be maimed or killed in industrial accidents, or toil in coal mines while we do cushy secretarial work and various yarn-themed activities. The fact that women have long been shut out of dangerous industrial jobs (by men, by the way) is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to commit suicide. Any pressures and expectations that lower the quality of life of any gender are part of patriarchy. The fact that depression is characterized as an effeminate weakness, making men less likely to seek treatment, is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to be viewed with suspicion when you take your child to the park (men frequently insist that this is a serious issue, so I will take them at their word). The assumption that men are insatiable sexual animals, combined with the idea that it\\'s unnatural for men to care for children, is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want you to be drafted and then die in a war while we stay home and iron stuff. The idea that women are too weak to fight or too delicate to function in a military setting is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists do not want women to escape prosecution on legitimate domestic violence charges, nor do we want men to be ridiculed for being raped or abused. The idea that women are naturally gentle and compliant and that victimhood is inherently feminine is part of patriarchy.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;Feminists hate patriarchy. We do not hate you.\\n&gt;\\n&gt;If you really care about those issues as passionately as you say you do, you should be thanking feminists, because feminism is a social movement actively dedicated to dismantling every single one of them. The fact that you blame feministsâyour alliesâfor problems against which they have been struggling for decades suggests that supporting men isn\\'t nearly as important to you as resenting women.

As has been said, women tend to be more vulnerable to sexual assault, at least in so far as reported statistics are concerned.  They arose out of a society that had institutionalized values that insulated men from abusing women, e.g., marital rape or laws that allowed for a modicum of physical abuse.  This typically occurred during a time when women had little of their own resources and relied primarily on their husband for basic necessities such as food and shelter, the echoes of which can still be felt today, most commonly in lower-class, minority neighborhoods (though this by no means should suggest that domestic abuse is a problem only in these communities.)\\n\\nMen experience abuse as well.  They experience abuse from female partners, same-sex partners, as well as parents - just like many other children - which domestic abuse shelters also cater to.  Much of what I said, save for the legal and historical underpinnings and effects, apply to men so I won't repeat them. \\n\\nThe fact that these harms are unique, experienced in a number of ways, have different root sources, result in various social sanctions (or lack thereof), and generally have all sorts of distinctions justifies having separate sex shelters to accommodate all of these needs.  I think it's proper because it can create a safe haven from abusers that is narrowly tailored to the disproportionate bargaining power between abuser and abused that commonly manifests itself in different ways between men and women.\\n\\nI don't think there is a nefarious or invidious purpose behind the discrimination and that it is instead meant to efficiently target unique problems.  Society reasonably discriminates in a number of ways and, if a government institution, is legally acceptable so long as it passes a certain scrutiny level.\\n\\nAs an aside, I will say that the issue of domestic abuse between same-sex partners is a wrinkle I don't know how to solve.  In this situation, gender-separated homes might not work they way they do for heterosexual couples as it would be easy for the abuser to walk into the haven and continue to cause problems.\\n\\nAs I said, I don't know how to fix this problem.  Many domestic abuse homes are faith-based and won't cater to gay people, period.  Moreover, many of the people in need of these shelters are runaways who had been shunned by their family and have nowhere to go, and either end up homeless (which is often criminalized) or in prostitution.  Creating shelters that outwardly cater to gay victims of domestic abuse, or who simply need some kind of shelter, is rife for abuse in that they often become recruiting grounds for pimps.\\n\\nThat last part was a tangent but I think it was worth mentioning since this discussion seemed centered entirely on the needs of traditional male-female couples.\", vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({'score': 3, 'top_level_comment': 'c9zjj2k', 'retrieved_on': 1431144835, 'gilded': 0, 'gildings': None, 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'stickied': False, 'permalink': '', 'author_flair_text': '63Î'}))\n",

Many if not most shelters were created independently due to a perceived need for them. So for example, person A has either experienced or witnessed first hand violence against women and a need for these shelters, and then creates the shelter to meet that need. It seems to me that the very existence alone of women's shelters isn't degrading to men simply because those resources for men haven't been created by individuals/communities. I think what you might actually be expressing is discontent with lack of similar resources for men, however, the only way to create those resources is if individuals like yourself or communities collectively decide to make it happen.\\n\\nAdditionally, most women's shelters arose during a period when many households were single income, with the man being the only source of money. This created a situation in which if a man needed to leave a relationship, he was much much more likely to have control of the family resources to do so, whereas a woman would literally have no financial way of leaving. Until as late as the 90's, women also had to have their husbands co-sign any sale of assets or property, whereas a man could make decisions about their property without any co-sign from their wife. Women's shelters provided a short-term place to stay for women who had no functional way to access joint resources due to unfair laws. While these circumstances have somewhat changed in that those laws have been repealed and most households are no longer singe-income, women still make significantly less than their male counterparts and are thus more likely to be at least partially dependent on their partners. This coupled with traditional gender roles of the man being independent and the woman needing help, increases the perceived need for women's shelters and thus the greater number of groups creating them. It is therefore not a degrading fact of life that there are many women's shelters and few men's shelters, but rather one moment in several decade long shift in our society's structure and attitudes on domestic violence that has not yet reached completion. With a continuation of the breaking down of strict gender roles and economic differences that have changed dramatically over the past 50 years, more and more awareness will be given to men's issues as well. Unfortunately this type of social change takes time, and we have only completed the first few legs of a long race.\\n\\nAlso,  I doubt very much that there would be a public outcry calling the very idea of a men's shelter sexist. Unlike men's schools or events which have an exclusionary history that makes them controversial, shelters don't show a perceived male dominance and exclusivity, but rather one of helping men who need help in a way that does not conform to their typical gender role, making it nonthreatening.\\n\\nAs to men's schools and events being considered sexist, I think we also need to step back into the history of men's schools/organizations and the origin of women's. Women's colleges (much like historically black colleges) first served as the only access women had at all for an education, featured few majors other than secretorial and teaching, were almost exclusively controlled by all male boards of directors and were far less prestigious than the multitude of options available to men. While this was originally a step up from the complete lack of education women had, they quickly became reminders of sexism within the college system. Women reinvented these sexist spaces to which they were confined as places of reinvention and social action to change their circumstances. Men's schools/groups were of course their opposite and at often times the direct superior supervisors of women's colleges and groups (This is how many sister colleges to famous schools worked). This put them in a place of authority and exclusivity over the women's colleges. While it was common to have male teachers and male presidents of women's colleges, it was almost unheard of to have women in positions of authority at men's colleges (some of this is still true today). It was only very recently that women's colleges have become competitive with men's colleges in a way that men would be at all desiring of attending in the first place. Because of this history of men's school exerting their power and prestige over women's groups, and because men's schools have simply been the ones with the prestige to exclude and women's schools have historically been less desirable, the idea of an all male school/organization has a vastly different connotation. While it might seem like all of this is long in the past, it is all too recent from a sociological perspective, and will take several more generations to erase those negative connotations. We are a society in transition, and I think people forget how quickly the standards we expect today have arisen.\", vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({'score': 2, 'top_level_comment': 'c9znqoq', 'retrieved_on': 1431142779, 'gilded': 0, 'gildings': None, 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'stickied': False, 'permalink': '', 'author_flair_text': '2â'}))\n",

Here is a link with a woman talking about it.\\n\\n[http://youtu.be/sns4Dhuw7Nk](http://youtu.be/sns4Dhuw7Nk)\\n\\nAt around 9:30 she talks about rape and how the numbers are wrong since rape can not be done by a women using the definition redefined by the FBI. \\n\\nThen at 11:30 she talks about a survey in which 40% of the people who forced sexual intercourse on another person where women however they are not rapists since rape with that definition can not be done by a woman. \\n\\nAfter at around 12:40 she talks about a study  done in 2005 which found that men are more likely to be forced into sexual intercourse by their female partners than the other way around.\\n\\nAt 16:15 she talks about a domestic violence shelter in which the founder found that the first 60 of 100 women who came in were just as violent or more violent then the men they left. The lady who founded the shelter then started try to advocate for male shelters and she received death threats for doing so.\\n\\n17:30 The majority of domestic violence is two people hitting each other with the women just as likely or even more likely to abuse their male partners. In fact in cases where violence against a non-violent partner was done was almost twice as likely to be done by a female.\\n\\n19:00 women are just as likely as men to strike their partner in an attempt to dominate or strike fear into their partner.\\n\\n21:24 Mandatory arrest policy forced police to arrest the aggressor on a domestic abuse call. It was used to try and counterattack the tendency for women to not want to press charges on their partners. This caused a 37% increase in men being arrested and a 446% increase in women being arrested. Feminists saw that must mean women are being arrested instead of men so then instead of police arresting who was causing the problems they would have to consider height, weight, strength and how distraught a partner appears compared to current approved models of violence which means it would always be the mans fault. The arrest rates when back to \"normal\" after.\\n\\n22:30 Male children as young as 12 are denied access to shelters from their abusive mothers. Battered men are refused help at state run shelters without even having a room at a motel/hotel to rest in for the night. Men who call domestic abuse hotlines are forwarded to batter hotlines instead of victim services. Men in abusive relationships with children have to either stay with the women or leave and let their child stay with the women who is abusive/violent.\\n\\nSo yes men need shelters just as much as women do the only difference is nobody cares about men who get hurt and men don\\'t complain since it\\'s seen as being weak, nobody caring about you regardless and you\\'ll just get into more trouble if you do anyway.', vectors: [], meta: ConvoKitMeta({'score': 2, 'top_level_comment': 'c9z9yen', 'retrieved_on': 1431136810, 'gilded': 0, 'gildings': None, 'subreddit': 'changemyview', 'stickied': False, 'permalink': '', 'author_flair_text': ''}))\n",
