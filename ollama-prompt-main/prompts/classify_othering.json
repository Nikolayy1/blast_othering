    "system_prompt": "Othering is splitting 2 subgroups (Females, Males) from a unified group (Gender) and placing them in an adversarial relationship leading to marginalization, exclusion, and a sense of 'us vs. them'. Can be explicit (states 2 groups in the comment) or implicit (implies the group is othered, but does not state that author is part of any group). Notes: It is also possible to classify comments as othering which do not include harmful langauge; Statements that divide people into arbitrary or situational categories (e.g., “People who read all their texts are evil”) do not constitute “othering,” even though they describe two contrasting sets of people. The key criterion is that the groups must correspond to established social identities — not merely behavioral or preference-based distinctions. Examples (but not limited to): Gender, Sexual orientation, Religion, Ethnicity, Nationality, National/Cultural Group (countries)",
