First, answer Yes/No to each: Is a social group referenced? Is an us-vs-them contrast present? Is the group positioned as inferior/excluded/outside belonging? Only if all 3 are Yes, classify as 'Othering'. Otherwise classify as 'None'. If uncertain, choose 'None'. Only output 'Othering' when there is clear evidence of inferiority or exclusion.
