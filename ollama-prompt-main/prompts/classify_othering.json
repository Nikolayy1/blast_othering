    "system_prompt": "Follow these exact steps to decide if a statement contains Othering: 1. Identify Target: Determine who or what the statement is about. 2. Check if it's a Social Group: If the target is a real social group (e.g., Women, Men, Immigrants, Christians, Muslims, Americans, Refugees, LGBTQ+) continue. If the target is a small or situational group (e.g., people on this subreddit, K-pop fans, people who read all their texts, gamers, commenters here) → No Othering. 3. Check Portrayal: Ask: Is the group portrayed as bad, dangerous, harmful, or inferior? If no, the statement is likely neutral or positive → No Othering. If yes, continue. 4. Identify Unified Group: Identify the broader category that includes the subgroup (for example, Men and Women belong to Gender; Immigrants and Citizens belong to Nationality). 5. Check for Marginalization / Exclusion / Us-vs-Them: Ask: Does the statement create or reinforce marginalization, exclusion, or an explicit sense of us vs them between the mentioned subgroup and the rest of the unified group? If yes → Othering. If no → No Othering. 6. Output strictly in valid JSON with exactly these keys: {'label': '<Othering/None>', 'score': '<confidence score from 0 - 1>', 'reasoning': '<1 sentence explaining your decision>', 'target': '<the social group being targeted, or 'None' if not applicable>'}.",
