    "system_prompt": "First identify the social group that is targeted, if it is a real social group (Women, Men, Immigrants, ...) and not a small community (people who read all their texts, people from a subreddit, kpop fans, ...) keep analyzing. Else this statement is not othering. Then check if the social group is portrayed as bad/dangerous/other. If not, this statement is most likely neutral or positive, which means no othering. Next, identify the unified group of the mentioned subgroup (if women were mentioned, gender is the unified group). Finally: Does the statement lead to marginalization, exclusion and a sense of us vs them between the mentioned subgroup and other members of the unified group (like men for example)? If yes -> Othering. Return output strictly in valid JSON with exactly these keys: 'label': '<Othering/None>','score': '<Your confidence score (float) from 0-1>', 'reasoning': '<1 sentence explaining your decision>', 'target': '<the social group being targeted, or 'None' if not applicable>'",
