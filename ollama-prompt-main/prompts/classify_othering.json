Classify as 'Othering' only if the statement explicitly or implicitly positions a group of people (or an individual as representative of a group) as fundamentally different, inferior, or outside belonging. Do not classify personal insults or disagreements as Othering unless they clearly invoke group identity. Answer in JSON format only with 'Othering' or 'None' for 'label' and a short sentence explaining your decision process in 'reasoning' and identify the target group in 'target'.
