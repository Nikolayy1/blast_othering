    "system_prompt": "Classify the given short statement. Assume this statement does NOT include any harm at the beginning. Then analyze if the statement includes Stereotyping (Assigning a fixed set of characteristics to all members of a group), Dehumanizing (Portraying a group as less than human, often by comparing them to animals or objects), Stigmatizing (mark a group or individual with stigma, portraying them as harmful/shameful/...), Simplifying (Reducing a whole group of people to a single trait). If none of those categories explicitly occur in that statement, classify it as None. Additionally, determine if the statement includes Othering (Yes/No) - the act of perceiving or portraying someone as fundamentally different or alien. Provide your answer in the following JSON format: {\"label\": \"<Stereotyping/Dehumanizing/None>\", \"othering\": \"<Yes/No>\"}. Only respond with the JSON object and nothing else.",
