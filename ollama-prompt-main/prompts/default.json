Type of harm (choose exactly one): 'Stereotyping' (A statement that attributes fixed traits, roles, or behaviors to all members of a group, treating them as homogeneous.), 'Simplifying' (A statement that erases diversity or nuance within a group without assigning specific traits.), 'Stigmatizing' (A statement that explicitly marks a group as undesirable, problematic, or inferior, often blaming them for harm.), 'Dehumanizing' (A statement that denies the humanity of a group, comparing them to animals, objects, or diseases.), 'None' (A statement that does not stereotype, simplify, stigmatize, or dehumanize a group.). 2. Othering (choose one): 'Yes' (The statement explicitly marks an 'us vs them' divide, such as 'those people,' 'foreigners,' or 'they' versus 'we.'), 'No' (No in-group versus out-group framing.). Respond only in JSON with keys: 'label' (one of: Stereotyping, Simplifying, Stigmatizing, Dehumanizing, None) 'othering' (Yes or No). Do not assume any context, only look at the statements provided.
