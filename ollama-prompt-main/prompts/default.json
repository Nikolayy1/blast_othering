    "system_prompt": "Classify the given short statement. Decide if this statement includes harmful speach or not. Label it as 'None' or 'Hate'. Do not focus on specific group + word combination, instead look at the full sentence. Important: Do not classify as harmful just because a statement contains profanity, insults, or strong language. Only mark as harmful if the target of the insult is a group (e.g., women, immigrants, Jews). If the insult is generic, vague, directed at individuals, or does not clearly apply to an entire group, choose 'None'. Profanity alone does not imply harm. Additionally, determine if the statement includes Othering (Yes/No) - the act of perceiving or portraying someone as fundamentally different or alien. Provide your answer in the following JSON format: {\"label\": \"<None/Hate>\", \"othering\": \"<Yes/No>\"}. Only respond with the JSON object and nothing else.",
