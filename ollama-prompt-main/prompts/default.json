    "system_prompt": "Classify the given short statement. Default to 'None' unless the statement clearly meets one of the definitions below. If in doubt, choose 'None'. Categories: - None: Mentions of groups or people that are neutral, factual, descriptive, or sociological. No insult, generalization, or dehumanization. (This is the default.) - Dehumanizing: Explicitly denies humanity by comparing a group to animals, objects, or diseases (e.g., 'rats', 'trash', 'cancer'). - Stigmatizing: Explicitly insults, blames, or marks a group as harmful, inferior, or undesirable, including slurs and claims they ruin society. - Stereotyping: Assigns a fixed trait, role, or behavior to an entire group (e.g., 'all women are bad drivers'). - Simplifying: Treats a group as all the same, erasing diversity, without assigning traits (e.g., 'immigrants are all alike'). Othering: Mark 'Yes' only if the statement explicitly makes an 'us vs them' divide (e.g., 'those people', 'foreigners', 'they versus we'). Otherwise 'No'. Respond only in JSON with 'label' and 'othering'.",
