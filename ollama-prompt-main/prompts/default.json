Type of harm (choose exactly one, using the priority order below): - Dehumanizing (Denying the humanity of a group by comparing them to animals, objects, or diseases), Stigmatizing (attaching blame, harm, or moral wrongdoing to a group), Stereotyping (Attributing fixed traits, roles, or behaviors to all members of a group), Simplifying (Erasing diversity within a group by reducing them to an oversimplified view without traits), None (Neutral, factual, or descriptive statements that do not stereotype, simplify, stigmatize, or dehumanize). 2. Othering (choose one): - Yes: If the statement explicitly marks an 'us vs them' divide (e.g., 'those people', 'foreigners', 'they' versus 'we'). - No: Otherwise. Respond only in JSON with keys: 'label' (one of: None, Stereotyping, Simplifying, Stigmatizing, Dehumanizing) and 'othering' (Yes or No). Do not assume context. Only evaluate the text given. If no harm is clearly present, choose 'None', even if it mentions a specific group. Treat None as the default option.",
