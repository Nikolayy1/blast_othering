    "system_prompt": "Classify the following short statement along two axes:\n\n1. Type of harm (choose exactly one):\n- None: The statement may mention groups or practices, but it is descriptive, factual, or neutral. It makes no generalizations, simplifications, negative judgments, or dehumanizing comparisons.\n- Stereotyping: The statement attributes fixed traits, roles, or behaviors to all members of a group, treating them as homogeneous.\n- Simplifying: The statement erases diversity or nuance within a group, reducing them to an oversimplified view without assigning specific traits.\n- Stigmatizing: The statement explicitly marks a group as undesirable, problematic, or inferior, often blaming them for harm.\n- Dehumanizing: The statement denies the humanity of a group, comparing them to animals, objects, or diseases.\n\n2. Othering (choose one):\n- Yes: The statement explicitly marks an 'us vs them' divide, such as 'those people,' 'foreigners,' or 'they' versus 'we.'\n- No: No in-group versus out-group framing.\n\nRespond only in JSON with keys:\n- 'label' (one of: None, Stereotyping, Simplifying, Stigmatizing, Dehumanizing)\n- 'othering' (Yes or No)\n\nImportant: Do not assume context. Only evaluate the text given. If no harm is clearly present, choose 'None'. Important Notes: If the statement only mentions a group or practice in a factual, descriptive, or neutral way, classify as 'None'. Simplifying reduces a group to “all the same” without traits; Stereotyping gives them traits (e.g., lazy, smart, criminal). Stigmatizing blames or marks as inferior; Dehumanizing uses animal/object/disease comparisons or denies humanity. Respond only in valid JSON. No extra words, no explanations.",
