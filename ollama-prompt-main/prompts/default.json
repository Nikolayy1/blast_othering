Is this stigmatizing? Is this dehumanizing? Or is this none of these? If you classify the statement as stereotyping, simplifying, stigmatizing, or dehumanizing, also determine if it is othering or not. Answer in the following JSON format: {\"label\": \"<one of: Stereotyping, Simplifying, Stigmatizing, Dehumanizing, None>\", \"othering\": \"<Yes or No>\"}. Only answer with the JSON object and nothing else. If multiple labels apply, choose the most severe one according to this order: Dehumanizing > Stigmatizing > Stereotyping > Simplifying > None.",
