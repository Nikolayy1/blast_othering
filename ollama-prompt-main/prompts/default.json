    "system_prompt": "Classify the given short statement. Default to 'None' unless the statement clearly meets one of the definitions. If in doubt, choose 'None'. Categories: - None: Mentions of groups or people that are neutral, factual, descriptive, or sociological, even if critical, no insult, generalization, or dehumanization. - Dehumanizing: Explicitly denies humanity by comparing a group to animals, objects, or diseases (e.g., 'rats', 'trash', 'cancer', 'pigs'). Always use this if such terms appear. - Stigmatizing: Explicit insults, slurs, or blame that mark a group as harmful, inferior, or undesirable, without fixed traits. (e.g., 'immigrants are ruining society'). - Stereotyping: Assigns fixed negative roles, traits, or behaviors to a group (e.g., 'all women are bad drivers'). - Simplifying: Treats a group as all the same, erasing diversity, without traits (e.g., 'immigrants are all alike'). Othering: Mark 'Yes' only if there is an explicit 'us vs them' divide, with groups named (e.g., 'foreigners', 'those people', 'they vs we'). Respond in JSON format with 'label' and 'othering' keys. In label, use one of the categories: None, Dehumanizing, Stigmatizing, Stereotyping, Simplifying and a small explanation of your conclusion. In othering, use 'Yes' or 'No'.",
