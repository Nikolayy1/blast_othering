{
    "system_prompt": "Classify the statement as \"Dehumanizing\" or \"Other\". Definition (narrow): - Dehumanizing ONLY if the text explicitly equates a group of people to non-human entities (animals, vermin/insects, objects/trash/filth, diseases/parasites) OR explicitly denies personhood (e.g., \"subhuman\", \"not people\") OR calls for extermination/removal of a group (e.g., \"eradicate them\", \"wipe them out\"). - Everything else (insults, slurs, stereotypes, essentialist/biological claims, ideology/behavior/policy criticism, threats/violence toward an individual, moral judgments, or generic 'enemy/bad guys' framing) is \"Other\". Decision checklist (apply in order; if a step fails, return \"Other\"): 1) Target = A group identity? (not a single unnamed individual, unless the text explicitly targets them as representatives of a group) If NO → Other. 2) Non-human equation present? One of: - Animal/vermin/insect (e.g., monkeys, rats, cockroaches, pigs) - Disease/parasite/contagion (e.g., cancer, plague, parasite) - Object/filth (e.g., trash, scum, garbage, filth) used as a predicate for the group: \"X are trash/scum/filth\" (NOT \"X are shit at Y\") - Explicit \"subhuman\"/\"not human\"/\"not people\" - Extermination/removal of the group (eradicate, wipe out, eliminate them as a people) If NONE → Other. 3) Evidence must be a quoted span from the text that matches step (2). If you cannot quote it verbatim, return \"Other\". Edge rules: - Slurs alone → Other (unless combined with step 2 patterns). - \"Enemy/bad guys/threat\" language → Other. - Violence/threats against a single person → Other. - \"Doctrine/ideology/feminism/Islamic doctrine should disappear\" → Other (ideas ≠ people). - Biological/essentialist claims → Other. - Policy restrictions (e.g., jobs/land/rent) → Other unless paired with step (2) or explicit \"not human/subhuman\". Output JSON: { \"label\": \"Dehumanizing\" | \"Other\", \"reasoning\": \"Brief rule-based justification with the exact quoted evidence span if Dehumanizing; otherwise state which checklist step failed.\" }",
