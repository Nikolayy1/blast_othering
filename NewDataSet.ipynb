Lethal diseases like measles are natural; vaccines that protect people from lethal diseases are unnatural, should we not get vaccinated and die from measles because it's natural? I don't get people who generalize natural always equals good. FYI, the animal kingdom do witness homosexual activities so homosexuality is ironically natural.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that those who believe 'natural' things are always good or superior may be misinformed or ignorant of the complexity of the issue. It also uses the example of homosexuality in the animal kingdom to argue against generalizations about what is natural, which could be perceived as positioning those with rigid views on nature and sexuality as inferior or outside the norm.\n",

      "Text: Answer my question about infertile people. Tell me, when did you choose to be straight? And being gay is so much more about sucking dicks, it is about developing love for the same gender. Just because you are incapable of love doesn't mean others are.\n",
      "Reason: The statement contains reductive language and negative attributes towards individuals who identify as gay or have difficulties with fertility, framing them as fundamentally different from the dominant group. This kind of language reinforces boundaries and positions the 'others' as inferior or outside belonging.\n",

      "Text: Thing is, many of the country where homosexuality is illegal, suffer from overpopulation. By the have kids, argument then sex using contraception or sex with an infertile person should also be outlawed. Ireland legalized same-sex marriage a few years ago and it still has the highest birth rates in the EU. A non harming individual is important. Oppressing gay people for reproduction is wrong, you should promote tax breaks and compensations for people to have more kids .\n",
      "Reason: The statement assigns negative attributes to groups where homosexuality is illegal and implies that these countries are overpopulated due to irresponsible reproductive behavior. It also reinforces boundaries between Ireland, which legalized same-sex marriage, and other countries with different laws regarding homosexuality.\n",

      "Text: Teaching children that it is ok to identify as gay/lesbian and the society wouldn't treat them unfairly, and their family would accept them for who they are, along with safe sex techniques isn't equality?\n",

Higher pay and lower duration of NS. More exemptions should be made for sportsman etc. Culture should change as well, NS men are lacking the respect they deserve.\n",
      "Reason: The statement contains negative or reductive attributes towards certain groups, such as women and NS men. It implies that women are not capable of handling physically intensive tasks and should be relegated to less demanding roles. Additionally, it suggests that NS men are lacking respect, which could be seen as reinforcing boundaries between the dominant group (the speaker) and the 'othered' group (NS men).\n",

So feminists better don't keep harping for equality, you might just get what you wish for.\n",

      "Text: Feminists want equal rights? They should fight for a place in NS too\n",
      "Reason: The statement implies that feminists are fighting for a place in NS (National Service), which may not be applicable to all individuals.

Also, to make it fair, both males and females will be assigned to all units i.e if there is a new nursing vocation, it’s not limited to just females; males can get assigned there too.

      "Reason: The statement implies that being gay is an inherent part of one's identity and cannot be changed, which may be perceived as othering or stigmatizing towards individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ but do not conform to societal expectations.\n",

      "Reason: The statement implies that the speaker does not want to support the cause of LGBTQ+ individuals and frames them as a separate group with different interests, which is a characteristic of othering.
