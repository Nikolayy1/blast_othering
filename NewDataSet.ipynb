      "Text: I agree with your points based on an a genderless society where effort equals payoff. The majority of females don't do equal lifting of heavy stuff and take more leave/off for pregnancy or caregiving reasons. But applying this rule will end up with us being a very uncaring society. So feminists better don't keep harping for equality, you might just get what you wish for.\n",

      "Text: Totally support for females to serve NS. Also, to make it fair, both males and females will be assigned to all units i.e if there is a new nursing vocation, it’s not limited to just females; males can get assigned there too. Doing this, we can reduce NS to 14 to 18 months and reservist cut down to four years. If only the government has the guts to do this.\n",

What if your neighbors are shitty or just plain don’t like your cat coming in and in extreme cases stealing their food/pooping and peeing around? AVA trapping or poison bait exercises in the area?

      "Text: I understand your stance. However it's a cause you don't believe in because you don't want your children to \"think it's ok to go down that route.\" If you accept that people are gay because they are born that way, surely it won't matter if the law exists because your children will either be born that way, or not.
