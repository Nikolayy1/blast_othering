      "Reason: The comment uses the term 'neckbeard' which is a derogatory slang for socially awkward or unattractive individuals. It also implies that talking in a certain way to a girl would make one come off as undesirable or inferior, thus creating an us-vs-them framing.\n",

      "Reason: The comment is an example of othering because it defines a group (kpop fangirls) as inferior or different from the speaker's 'us' by suggesting that they can be 'spoiled' or upset in a particular way. The tone is also somewhat mocking and stereotyping, implying that kpop fangirls are overly invested in the appearance of male idols and will be disappointed or shocked if they see them without makeup.\n",

      "Reason: The comment is an example of othering because it defines the person as fundamentally different or inferior. The speaker describes the person as 'so weird' and expresses a desire to not interact with them again ('Jesus I hope he never talks to me again'). This creates an us-vs-them framing, where the speaker is part of the 'us' group and the person is part of the 'them' group, which is being othered.\n",

End result was just people being surprised by how k pop idols look without make up, nothing awkward. I think people on this subreddit project too much when it comes to social awkwardness based on their own inadequacies.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that people who project social awkwardness are doing so based on their own inadequacies. This creates an 'us' vs 'them' dynamic where those who do not experience social awkwardness are seen as superior to those who do, which is a form of othering.\n",

      "Reason: The comment contains language that dehumanizes and excludes an individual or group. The speaker is addressing someone they perceive as socially awkward, calling them a 'loser' and implying they are unable to interact with women. This creates an us-vs-them dynamic, where the speaker positions themselves as superior to the person being addressed.\n",

      "ID: 7\n",
      "Text: Eee. Disgusting sia, your mouth got hole?\n",
      "Reason: The comment uses derogatory language to describe someone's appearance, specifically their mouth. The use of the word \"disgusting\" implies a strong negative judgment and dehumanization, which is a characteristic of othering.\n",

Rabid nationalism is a disease that needs to be addressed.\n",
      "Reason: The comment defines Singaporeans as having 'rabid nationalism' and being eager to start a 'losing war against Malaysia', which can be seen as dehumanizing or stereotyping an entire group of people based on their nationality. This framing creates an us-vs-them dynamic, where Singaporeans are portrayed as aggressive and irrational in their interactions with Malaysians.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that the speaker's mom has stereotypes and biases against gay people and men in general. The speaker mentions that their mom still thinks a male friend is gay simply because she was told so, and also that she allows female friends to stay over but not male friends. This kind of us-vs-them framing and stereotyping is an example of othering.\n",

      "Text: you are your own enemy\n",
      "Reason: The comment contains language that could be perceived as aggressive and confrontational towards an unspecified group ('those mofos'), which is a form of othering. The phrase 'you are your own enemy' can also imply blame or negative judgment, contributing to the othering tone.\n",

      "Reason: The comment uses dehumanizing language and us-vs-them framing to describe someone holding hands as 'disgusting' and implies they should be 'ashamed of themselves'. It also calls for the permanent ban of the poster, which is an exclusionary measure.\n",

So this law is simultaneously meaningless while also being of such importance to cause harm? You can't really have it both ways.\n",
      "Reason: The comment explicitly states that people from two specific groups (Christians and Catholics) are bigots preventing social progress.

Please just look at things like the AWARE saga, NLB book fiasco or the Wear White campaign. So yeah, your argument makes no sense, because there's correlation for one issue while none for the other.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that Christians and Catholics are fundamentally different or inferior due to their historical opposition to homosexuality. It also uses the AWARE saga, NLB book fiasco, or the Wear White campaign as examples of how these groups have handled issues related to homosexuality, framing them in an 'us-vs-them' manner.\n",

You can continue labouring under the delusion that all that stands in the way of gay marriage are Christians and Catholics.\n",
      "Reason: The comment contains language that dehumanizes and stereotypes Christians and Catholics, implying they are the primary obstacles to gay marriage. It also uses derogatory terms to describe someone's thinking and method of determining correlation.\n",

Let's call a spade a spade.\" Go ahead and try to shift the goal posts into \"whether Christians and Catholics are opposed to LGBT\". I'm done here.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that Christians and Catholics are bigots preventing social progress, which is a negative stereotype.

No one complains about using books from the Western canon to teach English.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that students who are not familiar with Mandarin are 'strangers' to the language, which can be seen as dehumanizing or exclusionary. Additionally, it contrasts Western and Chinese educational methods in a way that might perpetuate stereotypes.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that individuals who claim to be oppressed are simply 'thinking others are oppressing' them, which can be seen as dismissive and belittling of their experiences. It also makes a comparison between the grandson of LKY being openly gay and not seeming oppressed, implying that those who do feel oppressed may be overreacting or imagining things.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that the person being addressed is intentionally missing or avoiding the main issue and is being 'purposefully obtuse', which can be seen as dehumanizing or exclusionary. The tone of the comment is also somewhat aggressive, with phrases like 'you're not stupid enough' and 'stop if you want to try to achieve something', which may contribute to an us-vs-them framing.\n",

Depending on how you look at it, you can see this as discrimination against either gender.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that LGBT people are a minority and that the majority of relationships will be between men and women, which could be seen as reinforcing a heteronormative view.

Oppressing gay people for reproduction is wrong, you should promote tax breaks and compensations for people to have more kids .\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that countries where homosexuality is illegal are overpopulated and suggests that this is due to people in those countries having more children. This framing can be seen as othering because it defines a group (people from certain countries) as fundamentally different or inferior, implying that their societal issues are caused by their sexual orientation.\n",

      "Text: For a start... &#x200B; No teaching of children about homosexuality No housing benefits which are specifically for straight couples Dont start suing businesses who refuse to participate in your gay wedding\n",
      "Reason: The comment expresses opposition to teaching children about homosexuality and denies housing benefits to same-sex couples. It also implies that businesses should be allowed to refuse participation in gay weddings, which is an example of us-vs-them framing and exclusion.\n",

      "Text: Teaching children that it is ok to identify as gay/lesbian and the society wouldn't treat them unfairly, and their family would accept them for who they are, along with safe sex techniques isn't equality?\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that teaching children about acceptance of non-heterosexual identities and providing them with safe sex education is not equal or fair. This framing creates an 'us-vs-them' dynamic where certain groups (in this case, the LGBTQ+ community) are portrayed as fundamentally different or inferior to others (heterosexual individuals). The use of derogatory language ('what the fuck') further emphasizes the othering tone.\n",

Higher pay and lower duration of NS. More exemptions should be made for sportsman etc. Culture should change as well, NS men are lacking the respect they deserve.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that women are less capable of handling physically intensive tasks and should be relegated to less demanding roles. This perpetuates a stereotype that women are weaker or less competent than men, which is an example of othering.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that women are inherently less productive than men due to their periods and should be paid less as a result. This is an example of othering because it defines women as fundamentally different from men in a way that is derogatory and discriminatory.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that women are less productive due to their periods, which is a stereotype. It also suggests that they should be paid less because of this perceived difference in productivity, which is discriminatory and dehumanizing.\n",

      "Reason: The comment refers to \"black sheep\" that 'fake' their way out of nice things for everything in life. This implies that there is an 'us' (people with genuine issues/concerns) and a 'them' (those who are taking advantage or faking their problems), which is a form of othering.\n",

So feminists better don't keep harping for equality, you might just get what you wish for.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that the majority of females are not equal to males in terms of physical strength and need more time off for caregiving reasons. It also states that applying a rule based on equality will result in an 'uncaring society', framing feminists as a group that is asking for something they might regret getting. This creates an us-vs-them dynamic, where the speaker is positioning themselves as part of a group that understands the importance of considering differences between men and women, while feminists are portrayed as overly idealistic or naive.\n",

Unless the govt deems it really necessary due to the declining population, then fair enough.\n",
      "Reason: The comment expresses opposition to women serving in the military, implying that they are not suited for such roles and should not participate unless absolutely necessary. It also uses a somewhat derogatory tone when referring to women, stating that they would be 'wasting 2 years of their lives just to make a point'. This kind of language contributes to an 'us-vs-them' framing, where the speaker is creating a division between men and women, with women being seen as inferior or less capable. Furthermore, the comment assumes that the majority of men share this opinion, which reinforces the stereotype that men are more competent or superior in certain areas.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that men and women should be treated differently in terms of their service duration, with both serving only 1 year, similar to South Korea. This creates an 'us' vs 'them' dynamic between the speaker's country (implied to be Singapore) and another country (South Korea), as well as between men and women, which is a form of othering.\n",

      "Text: Feminists want equal rights? They should fight for a place in NS too\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that feminists are a separate group from 'us' (the speaker and possibly their audience) and need to fight for inclusion in NS (likely referring to National Service), which is not necessarily true. The tone of the comment seems somewhat dismissive or condescending towards feminists, framing them as a distinct group with different goals or priorities.\n",

Dogs in the neighborhood (stray or owned) seeing an easy target to harass? Asshole sociopathic kids? Singapore is too heavily urbanised and hostile of a place to support free-roaming cats.\n",
      "Reason: The comment exhibits othering by defining certain groups as 'shitty neighbors', 'asshole sociopathic kids', and implying that these individuals are fundamentally different or inferior. The tone is also somewhat dehumanizing, particularly towards the children being described.\n",

So can you imagine the psychological trauma these non binary teens are facing to identify as a machine or a banana?\n",
      "Reason: The comment expresses concerns about the 'gay agenda', which implies a negative view of the LGBTQ+ community. It also uses derogatory language when referring to non-binary teens, comparing their identity to inanimate objects like machines or bananas. This kind of language contributes to the marginalization and exclusion of these groups.\n",

      "Reason: The comment implies that being gay is an inherent part of a person's identity and cannot be changed. However, it also includes the phrase 'I respect their choice', which suggests that being gay might be a matter of personal preference or decision-making. This contradictory message can contribute to othering by implying that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are different from others in a way that is not respectful or inclusive.\n",

      "Text: agree with all of this plus, there are religious people/people living in conservative countries who struggle with being gay. If sexuality was a choice, then why wouldn't they just '''''choose''''' to be straight and not have to worry about being persecuted or ostracised? sigh\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that people in conservative countries who are gay could simply 'choose' to be straight and avoid persecution or ostracism. This framing is an example of othering because it defines a group (gay individuals) as having a choice in their sexual orientation, which can lead to stereotypes, dehumanization, exclusion, or us-vs-them framing.\n",

I feel so offended but whatever. smh.\n",
      "Reason: The comment contains an example of othering because the speaker's mom dehumanizes and stereotypes the speaker's girlfriend by calling her 'ugly' and implying that she is inferior to other potential partners. This creates an us-vs-them framing, where the speaker's mom is positioning herself and possibly her friend's daughter as superior to the speaker's girlfriend.\n",

      "Text: Your mom's Savage. But if you're not in it for the eye candy then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, maybe she's right.\n",
      "Reason: The comment objectifies the speaker's mom by referring to her as 'eye candy', implying that she is being judged based on physical appearance rather than being treated with respect and dignity. This kind of language can contribute to a culture of sexism and misogyny, where women are viewed as objects for male gratification rather than as individuals with agency and autonomy.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 88\n",
      "Text: Your mum savage AF sia...\n",
      "Reason: The comment uses the term 'savage' to describe someone's mother in a derogatory manner. The tone is informal and casual, but it still implies that the person being referred to is somehow less deserving of respect or dignity due to their relationship with the speaker.\n",

      "Reason: The text compares people involved in illegal football betting to 'some bad shit' and implies they might be targeted by law enforcement ('swat'), framing them as a threat or problem.

      "Reason: The comment implies that gay pride parades and healthy gay relationships are 'culturally deviant', which is an example of othering as it defines the group (gay people) as fundamentally different or inferior in opposition to an 'us' (presumably straight people).
