      "Text: I agree with your points based on an a genderless society where effort equals payoff. The majority of females don't do equal lifting of heavy stuff and take more leave/off for pregnancy or caregiving reasons. But applying this rule will end up with us being a very uncaring society. So feminists better don't keep harping for equality, you might just get what you wish for.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that if women are given equal opportunities, they will be unable to handle the responsibilities due to their physical limitations and caregiving roles, positioning them as inferior.\n",

      "Text: I'm a guy and I oppose women serving NS, and I feel THAT's the non political correct thought lol, amongst men probably. I don't want the other half of the local population to waste 2 years of their lives just to make a point. Unless the govt deems it really necessary due to the declining population, then fair enough.\n",
      "Reason: The text expresses a clear us-vs-them contrast by opposing women serving in the military and positioning men as the norm, while also implying that women's participation would be a waste of time.\n",

      "Text: Yeah I agree with you but the previous guy stated that women should be paid less because their periods make them less productive, using a friend who took MC because of cramps as an example. That, I believe, is going overboard.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that women are less productive due to their periods and should be paid less, which is an inferior and exclusionary view.\n",

      "Text: It’s not just about falls from height, you know. What if your neighbors are shitty or just plain don’t like your cat coming in and in extreme cases stealing their food/pooping and peeing around? AVA trapping or poison bait exercises in the area? Dogs in the neighborhood (stray or owned) seeing an easy target to harass? Asshole sociopathic kids? Singapore is too heavily urbanised and hostile of a place to support free-roaming cats.\n",
      "Reason: The text creates an us-vs-them contrast by referencing 'shitty' neighbors and 'asshole sociopathic kids', positioning these groups as inferior or hostile. It also references stray dogs and asshole sociopathic kids as potential threats to the cat, further emphasizing the exclusion of these groups.\n",

      "Text: I am too worried of the gay agenda. If you look towards gender fluidity, you can kind of sense a sub culture brewing. I’m schizophrenic and I think of myself as a machine sometimes. So can you imagine the psychological trauma these non binary teens are facing to identify as a machine or a banana?\n",
      "Reason: The text expresses concerns and worries about the 'gay agenda' and implies that non-binary teens identifying as machines or bananas is a form of psychological trauma, positioning them as inferior or outside belonging.\n",

      "Text: >I respect their choice I’m sorry but this is a really big misunderstanding, sexuality isn’t a choice, it’s who you are. If your future children are gay then they are gay, there is nothing that will change that, 377a or not. I hope you understand\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that being gay is not a choice and that individuals who are gay will always be gay, which may be perceived as positioning the group as inferior or outside of societal norms.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 82\n",
      "Text: I’m not forcing 377A on anybody. I just don’t like my friends, gay or otherwise, coming to me and telling me to sign whatever petition and go to pink dot to support them. Like I said, I respect your sexuality (not choice, I know), but respect my right to not support your cause.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that the speaker does not want to support the cause of gay rights and positions themselves as having the right to choose whether or not to do so, while also stating they respect others' sexuality. This creates an us-vs-them contrast where the speaker is positioned as outside of the group seeking support for gay rights, implying exclusion.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 83\n",
      "Text: agree with all of this plus, there are religious people/people living in conservative countries who struggle with being gay. If sexuality was a choice, then why wouldn't they just '''''choose''''' to be straight and not have to worry about being persecuted or ostracised? sigh\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that being gay is a 'choice' and positions people who are gay as inferior or less desirable than those who are straight, which can lead to social exclusion.\n",

I feel so offended but whatever. smh.\n",
      "Reason: The speaker's mother makes a derogatory comment about the girlfriend's appearance and suggests that the speaker should meet other girls, positioning the girlfriend as inferior and outside belonging.\n",

      "Text: If u daring enough. U could always go with the \"who is the Groom? You or her. If she like the other girl then ask her to marry her lah.\" *note this is likely to be a suicide mission so results may vary.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that the speaker's girlfriend might be interested in another girl, positioning the group of people who are attracted to the same sex as inferior or outside the norm.\n",

      "Text: >showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went \"huh she's so ugly\" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices. Huh. Usually what I hear is the mum asking if the girl is blind cos who would want their son.\n",
      "Reason: The comment implies that the speaker's mother is making an us-vs-them contrast by belittling the girl in the photo and suggesting that the speaker should consider other options, positioning the girl as inferior or not good enough.\n",

      "Text: Because there are a lot of Singaporeans who are entitled. Anything less than perfect is a henious crime that shows the government isn't capable at all. Standards are far from realistic and like Nas said. Most Singaporeans lack perspective. For example. Everyone knows we are a \"resourceless\" nation. But to fully understand and comprehend the costs and danger of that is something that barely anyone begins to think about. Its scary to see how quickly how hateful, aggressive and in some cases, racist, some Singaporeans can become.\n",
      "Reason: The text positions a subgroup of Singaporeans as inferior due to their entitlement, lack of perspective, and potential for hateful or racist behavior, creating an us-vs-them contrast.\n",

      "Text: Women used to be deemed unable to consent. And if you don't need animals' consent to kill them to eat, why do you need their consent to fuck them? Also virtually everyone who claims that all consensual sex should be allowed is against incest.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that women are inferior and excluded from belonging by referencing their historical lack of consent in sexual matters. It also creates an us-vs-them contrast between those who support consensual sex and those who oppose incest.\n",

      "ID: 98\n",
      "Text: maybe the answer is to make more things illegal. Like BDSM and foreplay. Only missionary. Maybe doggie cos animals do it so it is considered natural.\n",
      "Reason: The text implies that certain sexual practices are unnatural or inferior, positioning those who engage in them as outside the norm. This creates an us-vs-them contrast and excludes individuals based on their sexual preferences.\n",

      "Text: Actually homophilic excesses are turning me off gay marriage\n",
      "Reason: The comment expresses a negative attitude towards gay marriage, referencing 'homophilic excesses' as a turn-off. This implies that the speaker views LGBT+ individuals or their relationships as inferior or problematic, which is an othering behavior.\n",
