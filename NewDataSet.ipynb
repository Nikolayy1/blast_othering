      "Text: I understand your stance. However it's a cause you don't believe in because you don't want your children to \"think it's ok to go down that route.\" If you accept that people are gay because they are born that way, surely it won't matter if the law exists because your children will either be born that way, or not. I mean, nobody ever said \"Let's go against SINDA in case the children think it's ok to turn Indian.\"\n",
      "Reason: Positions LGBTQ+ individuals as fundamentally different and potentially threatening to children.\n",

      "Text: so i told my parents about my gf. but i didnt really tell them that she's my gf but instead told them that ive been seeing her for awhile now. showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went \"huh she's so ugly\" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices. also told me that she planning to make me meet her friend's daughter who she deem is prettier. I feel so offended but whatever. smh.\n",
      "Reason: Your mom creates a boundary by devaluing your girlfriend based on appearance and suggesting alternatives, implying that your choice is not good enough.\n",

      "Text: Because there are a lot of Singaporeans who are entitled. Anything less than perfect is a henious crime that shows the government isn't capable at all. Standards are far from realistic and like Nas said. Most Singaporeans lack perspective. For example. Everyone knows we are a \"resourceless\" nation. But to fully understand and comprehend the costs and danger of that is something that barely anyone begins to think about. Its scary to see how quickly how hateful, aggressive and in some cases, racist, some Singaporeans can become.\n",
      "Reason: Creates a boundary between 'us' (implied to be the majority of reasonable Singaporeans) and 'some Singaporeans' who are portrayed as entitled, lacking perspective, and prone to hatefulness, racism, or aggression.\n",

      "Text: Women used to be deemed unable to consent. And if you don't need animals' consent to kill them to eat, why do you need their consent to fuck them? Also virtually everyone who claims that all consensual sex should be allowed is against incest.\n",
      "Reason: Creates an analogy between animals and women to imply that women's consent is irrelevant or unimportant.\n",

      "Text: Have you seen gay pride parades in the US? Despite normalizing healthy gay relationships they are still deliberately culturally deviant\n",
      "Reason: Positions LGBTQ+ individuals as inherently different and outside the norm by using the term 'culturally deviant'.\n",

      "Text: maybe the answer is to make more things illegal. Like BDSM and foreplay. Only missionary. Maybe doggie cos animals do it so it is considered natural.\n",
      "Reason: Positions certain sexual practices as unnatural or less desirable, invoking an in-group (those who practice missionary position) and out-groups (those who engage in other forms of sex).\n",

      "Text: Actually homophilic excesses are turning me off gay marriage\n",
      "Reason: Associates a group (LGBT+ folks) with negative outcomes (suicide rates as homophilic excesses), implicitly suggesting they are inherently problematic or dysfunctional.\n",
