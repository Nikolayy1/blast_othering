      "Text: >I respect their choice I’m sorry but this is a really big misunderstanding, sexuality isn’t a choice, it’s who you are. If your future children are gay then they are gay, there is nothing that will change that, 377a or not. I hope you understand\n",
      "Reason: Implies that being gay is a choice and something that can be changed, which could lead to exclusion or marginalization of LGBTQ+ individuals.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 82\n",
      "Text: I’m not forcing 377A on anybody. I just don’t like my friends, gay or otherwise, coming to me and telling me to sign whatever petition and go to pink dot to support them. Like I said, I respect your sexuality (not choice, I know), but respect my right to not support your cause.\n",
      "Reason: Implies that LGBTQ+ individuals are imposing their views on others and creates a sense of 'us vs. them'.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 84\n",
      "Text: I understand your stance. However it's a cause you don't believe in because you don't want your children to \"think it's ok to go down that route.\" If you accept that people are gay because they are born that way, surely it won't matter if the law exists because your children will either be born that way, or not. I mean, nobody ever said \"Let's go against SINDA in case the children think it's ok to turn Indian.\"\n",
      "Reason: Implies that people who are gay or support the LGBTQ+ community would influence children to be gay, creating an 'us vs. them' dynamic and positioning the LGBTQ+ community as a threat.\n",

      "Text: so i told my parents about my gf. but i didnt really tell them that she's my gf but instead told them that ive been seeing her for awhile now. showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went \"huh she's so ugly\" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices. also told me that she planning to make me meet her friend's daughter who she deem is prettier. I feel so offended but whatever. smh.\n",
      "Reason: The speaker's mom dehumanizes the girlfriend by calling her 'ugly', implying she is inferior and not good enough for her son.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 86\n",
      "Text: If u daring enough. U could always go with the \"who is the Groom? You or her. If she like the other girl then ask her to marry her lah.\" *note this is likely to be a suicide mission so results may vary.\n",
      "Reason: Implies 'she' is fundamentally different from 'us', creating an 'us vs. them' dynamic.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 87\n",
      "Text: Your mom's Savage. But if you're not in it for the eye candy then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, maybe she's right.\n",
      "Reason: Implies 'your mom' is objectified and judged based on appearance.\n",
      "-----\n",
      "ID: 89\n",
      "Text: >showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went \"huh she's so ugly\" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices. Huh. Usually what I hear is the mum asking if the girl is blind cos who would want their son.\n",
      "Reason: Dehumanizes the girl in the photo by focusing on her appearance and suggesting she is not good enough.\n",

      "Text: Because there are a lot of Singaporeans who are entitled. Anything less than perfect is a henious crime that shows the government isn't capable at all. Standards are far from realistic and like Nas said. Most Singaporeans lack perspective. For example. Everyone knows we are a \"resourceless\" nation. But to fully understand and comprehend the costs and danger of that is something that barely anyone begins to think about. Its scary to see how quickly how hateful, aggressive and in some cases, racist, some Singaporeans can become.\n",
      "Reason: Suggests a subset of Singaporeans are flawed and lack perspective, creating an 'us vs. them' dynamic within the group.\n",

      "Text: Welcome to the internet. Somewhere out there (in conversations, other forums) it will be discussed. &#x200B; If you understood the balance of it being a meme and truth behind it as well. Not trying to argue here. &#x200B; Singapore **is** taking precautions, and this would be a good opportunity to catch dangerous persons. There is still good to come out of it.\n",
      "Reason: Creates an 'us vs. them' dynamic by suggesting certain individuals are dangerous and need to be caught.\n",

      "Text: Women used to be deemed unable to consent. And if you don't need animals' consent to kill them to eat, why do you need their consent to fuck them? Also virtually everyone who claims that all consensual sex should be allowed is against incest.\n",
      "Reason: Implies women are objects to be used and that they cannot give consent.\n",

      "ID: 97\n",
      "Text: Have you seen gay pride parades in the US? Despite normalizing healthy gay relationships they are still deliberately culturally deviant\n",
      "Reason: Implies that being part of the LGBTQ+ community is 'culturally deviant', creating an 'us vs. them' dynamic.\n",

      "ID: 98\n",
      "Text: maybe the answer is to make more things illegal. Like BDSM and foreplay. Only missionary. Maybe doggie cos animals do it so it is considered natural.\n",
      "Reason: Implies certain sexual practices are unnatural or unacceptable, creating an 'us vs. them' dynamic.\n",

      "Text: What im saying face to face they dont complain as much. maybe in private or online. Compared to the sg. The sg im referring to arent foreigners, they are just there for studies riding on daddy's money. Most of the Malaysians and Filipinos are there using hard earned money they themselves earned.\n",
      "Reason: Creates an 'us vs. them' dynamic by suggesting that certain groups are less deserving of respect or dignity based on their nationality and financial situation.\n",
