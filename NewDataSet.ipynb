I do feel that it sucks that the government doesn't provide more support to singles (especially single parents) when it comes to housing, but we were discussing about what discrimination gay couples face, not the issue of singles\n",
      "Reason: The comment contains an us-vs-them contrast by referencing 'angry incel' in a derogatory manner and implying that this group does not deserve access to public housing. The group is also positioned as inferior due to the mention of limited government support for their housing needs.\n",
