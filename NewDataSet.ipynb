      "Reason: The comment targets a social group (kpop fangirls) and creates an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that the speaker is going to play a prank on them.

      "Reason: The comment creates an 'us vs them' contrast by portraying the Kpop fan as fundamentally different and inferior compared to the speaker.

      "Reason: The comment targets people on the subreddit who project social awkwardness based on their own inadequacies.

      "Reason: The comment creates an 'us vs them' contrast by calling someone a 'loser', implying that they are fundamentally different and inferior.

      "Reason: The comment creates an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that the speaker's experience is different from the listener's because of their gender.

      "Reason: The comment targets a social group based on gender and sexual orientation. It creates an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that the speaker's mom is close-minded about her son's gay friend and male friends in general, while being more accepting of female friends.

      "Reason: The comment 'you are your own enemy' can be seen as creating an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that someone is their own opposition or obstacle.

      "Reason: The comment targets individuals who engage in public displays of affection (PDA), specifically hand-holding. It creates an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that those who hold hands are fundamentally different and inferior compared to the speaker's group.

So this law is simultaneously meaningless while also being of such importance to cause harm? You can't really have it both ways.\n",
      "Reason: The comment targets Christians and Catholics, portraying them as bigots that prevent social progress. This creates an 'us vs them' contrast, where the speaker's group is implied to be progressive and open-minded, while the targeted groups are portrayed as close-minded and obstructive.

      "Reason: The comment targets specific social groups (Christians and Catholics) and portrays them as bigots preventing social progress. It also implies that these groups are responsible for reducing the prevalence of sex crimes, which is a form of exclusion and delegitimization.

Please just look at things like the AWARE saga, NLB book fiasco or the Wear White campaign. So yeah, your argument makes no sense, because there's correlation for one issue while none for the other.\n",
      "Reason: The comment targets Christians and Catholics, portraying them as fundamentally different due to their stance on sex crimes and homosexuality. It creates an 'us vs them' contrast by implying that these groups are not speaking out against sex crimes as much as they should, and also implies that they are more conservative and opposed to homosexuality compared to others.

You can continue labouring under the delusion that all that stands in the way of gay marriage are Christians and Catholics.\n",

It portrays women as not having any actual problems or disadvantages due to this mindset, which can be seen as downplaying or dismissing their experiences and perspectives. The comment also implies that the speaker's perception is more accurate or relevant than the concerns of women, which can be seen as delegitimizing their views.\n",

It also suggests that married couples who do not reproduce are less legitimate or less worthy of the concept of family. The 'us vs them' framing is implicit, as the speaker assumes a higher moral ground based on their own values regarding family.
