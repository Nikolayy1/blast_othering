Stigmatizing means assigning blame, moral wrongdoing, or harm to a person/group in a way that reinforces exclusion or shame.

If the statement includes a stereotype/simplifies AND assigns blame, do NOT label it as stigmatizing. Do not assume any context, only take the literal meaning of the text into account.
