He died in 2004. After his death, the first book was published in Sweden in Swedish. With the title \"M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor\" - which translates as 'Men who hate women'. In 2008, it was published in the UK as 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.'\n\nSo Larsson never actually knew he was a bestselling author. He was a journalist, wrote for magazines, but not books."
