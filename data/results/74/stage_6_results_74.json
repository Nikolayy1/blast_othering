Definition of othering: Othering is the process of constructing a group of people as fundamentally different and inferior compared to an 'us'. It involves us-vs-them framing, stereotyping, exclusion, or dehumanization. Not every stereotype, insult, or joke counts as othering. Use this decision tree to decide: Does the comment target a social group (race, gender, nationality, religion, ...)? If not, classify as None. Does the comment create an 'us vs them' contrast (explicitly or implicitly)? If not, classify as None. Does the comment portray the group as inferior, irrational, abnormal, or less legitimate? If not, classify as None. Does the comment exclude, delegitimize, or dehumanize the group? If yes, classify as Othering, if not classify as None.
