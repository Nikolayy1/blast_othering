Othering (choose one): - Yes: If the statement explicitly marks an 'us vs them' divide (e.g., 'those people', 'foreigners', 'they' versus 'we'). - No: Otherwise. Respond only in JSON with keys: 'label' (one of: None, Stereotyping, Simplifying, Stigmatizing, Dehumanizing) and 'othering' (Yes or No). Do not assume context. Only evaluate the text given. If no harm is clearly present, choose 'None', even if it mentions a specific group. Treat None as the default option. If multiple types of harm are present, choose the one with the highest priority (Dehumanizing > Stigmatizing > Stereotyping > Simplifying > None).",
