Just as a person can claim to be both Singaporean and Christian, they can also be Singaporean and Malayan. I honestly don't know see what's the big deal, and why FB comments are rife with siege mentality. It's like Singaporeans can't wait to start a losing war against Malaysia. Rabid nationalism is a disease that needs to be addressed. "

The method by which you \"determined\" correlation is laughably dumb. Saudi Arabia has no Catholics and Christians, why don't they have gay marriage as well? But its okay. You can continue labouring under the delusion that all that stands in the way of gay marriage are Christians and Catholics. \n\n"

But there are of course ways around that. And two women usually will have a womb between them so most two-woman couples can give birth to a child"
