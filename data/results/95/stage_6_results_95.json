Else this statement is not othering. Then check if the social group is portrayed as bad/dangerous/other. If not, this statement is most likely neutral or positive, which means no othering. Next, identify the unified group of the mentioned subgroup (if women were mentioned, gender is the unified group). Finally: Does the statement lead to marginalization, exclusion and a sense of us vs them between the mentioned subgroup and other members of the unified group (like men for example)?
