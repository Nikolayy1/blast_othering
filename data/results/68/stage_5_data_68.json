End result was just people being surprised by how k pop idols look without make up, nothing awkward. I think people on this subreddit project too much when it comes to social awkwardness based on their own inadequacies."

The method by which you \"determined\" correlation is laughably dumb. Saudi Arabia has no Catholics and Christians, why don't they have gay marriage as well? But its okay. You can continue labouring under the delusion that all that stands in the way of gay marriage are Christians and Catholics."

Lethal diseases like measles are natural; vaccines that protect people from lethal diseases are unnatural, should we not get vaccinated and die from measles because it's natural? I don't get people who generalize natural always equals good. FYI, the animal kingdom do witness homosexual activities so homosexuality is ironically natural."
