Stigmatizing means assigning blame, moral wrongdoing, or harm to a person/group in a way that reinforces exclusion or shame. General insults directed at a group are stigmatizing. Insults directed only at an individual are not stigmatizing unless they attach broader blame to a group. If the statement includes a stereotype, do NOT label it as stigmatizing. Do not assume any context, only take the literal meaning of the text into account.
