'Othering' is the act of viewing and treating individuals or groups as fundamentally different from oneself or one's own group, leading to marginalization, exclusion, and a sense of 'us vs. them'.

Othering can occur based on various differences like race, gender, religion, or socioeconomic status and can escalate to prejudice, discrimination, and even violence Answer in JSON format only with 'Othering' or 'None' for 'label' and a short sentence explaining your decision process in 'reasoning' and identify the target group in 'target'.",
